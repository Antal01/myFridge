## About The Project  
The Fridge app aims to simplify users' lives by allowing them to easily manage the contents of their fridge. With this app, users can effortlessly add, delete, or modify items, including changing their quantities or names.

Not only does the app provide users with real-time information about what's in their fridge, but it also offers recipe suggestions based on the available ingredients. These recipes can be sorted according to ratings or by the presence or absence of specific ingredients. Additionally, users can search for new recipes based on a given ingredient.

The ultimate goal of the app is to streamline the user's food search experience and make meal planning more convenient.
